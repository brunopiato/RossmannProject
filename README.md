## 1. Introduction

Rossmann company operates over 4,000 drugstores around European countries such as Germany, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Turkey, Albania, Kosovo, Israel and Spain with a revenue of over €10 billion.

To achieve this, we used a combination of time series analysis and machine learning algorithms, following the steps inside the CRISP-DM methodology:
